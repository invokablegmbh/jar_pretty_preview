What does it do?
================

*  When building individual content elements, a nice backend preview often falls by the wayside (due to budget or time). The editors have to deal with this, as they are overwhelmed by gray boxes with one-liners in the backend.
   
*  With this extension you can generate a nice preview of (almost) any content element within a very short time.

*  How does it works?

   *  Pretty Preview loads the underlaying data and TCA structure and generates a preview based on the visible and filled fields for the current user.

Installation
============

**Composer**

You can install `jar_pretty_preview` with following shell command:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer req jar/jar_pretty_preview


**Extensionmanager**

If you want to install `jar_pretty_preview` traditionally with Extensionmanager, follow these steps:

#. Visit ExtensionManager

#. Switch over to `Get Extensions`

#. Search for `jar_pretty_preview`

#. Install extension

Configuration
=============

Just register your pretty preview via TCA override in your extension with the following command:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: EXT:your_extension/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php

   \Jar\PrettyPreview\Utilities\PreviewUtility::registerContentElement(
      <CType>,
      <configuration>
   );
   
.. confval:: CType

   :Required: true
   :type: string   

   The CType of your content element.

.. confval:: configuration

   :Required: false
   :type: array   

   You are able to configure the following options:

   .. tip::
      For white- and blacklisting columns, you can use wildcards like "?" and "*". So instead of define
      ``table_class, table_caption, table_delimiter, table_enclosure, ...`` specificly, you can use ``table_*``.

   .. confval:: tableColumnWhitelist

      :Required: false
      :type: array

      List of table specific columns which aren’t processed, grouped by table.

   .. confval:: tableColumnBlacklist

      :Required: false
      :type: array

      List of tables columns which should be processed exclusively, grouped by table.
   
   .. confval:: nestingDepth

      :Required: false
      :type: integer

      Depth of displayed subrelations to other table records.

**Example:**

We want to pretty preview the "table" content element, but just want to preview the content of all fields starting with ``table_*`` and ``bodtext`` without ``table_delimiter`` and ``table_enclosure``.

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: Example of EXT:your_extension/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php

   \Jar\PrettyPreview\Utilities\PreviewUtility::registerContentElement('table', [
      'tableColumnWhitelist' => [
         'tt_content' => ['table_*', 'bodytext']
      ],
      'tableColumnBlacklist' => [
         'tt_content' => ['table_delimiter', 'table_enclosure']
      ],
      'nestingDepth' => 2,
   ]);
