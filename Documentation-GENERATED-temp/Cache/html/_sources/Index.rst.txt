What does it do?
================

*  When building individual content elements, a nice backend preview often falls by the wayside (due to budget or time). The editors have to deal with this, as they are overwhelmed by gray boxes with one-liners in the backend.
   
*  With this extension you can generate a nice preview of (almost) any content element within a very short time.

*  How does it works?

   *  Pretty Preview loads the underlaying data and TCA structure and generates a preview based on the visible and filled fields for the current user.
